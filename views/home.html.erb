          <p class="paragraph-6">
            Stucco is one of the most robust materials on the market. But due to its rigid nature, stucco can develop cracks and holes over time due to sediment and surface damage.
          <p class="paragraph-6">
            When a crack or hole appears, it is necessary to take prompt action before any more damage can occur and further penetrate the surface area.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-6">
            You can try to repair cracks yourself but the money you save in the short term will cost you in the long run if you improperly repair your stucco. The future repairs costs can potentially run into the thousands.

          <p class="paragraph-6">
            Stucco is a common finishing material used in residential and commercial construction for interior and exterior applications. When properly applied, it&#x27;s documented to last for 50 years or more.
          <p class="paragraph-6">
            However, over time, you may want to change your home&#x27;s look and feel, or you may find that the original stucco needs to be re-colored due to cracking or fading.

          <p class="paragraph-6">
            Tex-Cote is an outer coating that provides structure to the surface to which it is applied. It is sometimes referred to as the ideal choice for keeping a weather-proof house.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-6">
            Unfortunately, with enough time, you may begin to see peeling, cracking, and flaking. This is usually a symptom of improperly applied Tex-Cote or plain age.

          <p class="paragraph-6">
            Are significant areas of your textured walls crumbling away?

            If so, we can help you diagnose the problem. But don&#x27;t delay; Tex-Cote peeling &amp; flaking can quickly become a nightmare in repairs and costs.
