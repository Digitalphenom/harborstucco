          <p class="paragraph-6">
            Stucco is one of the most robust materials on the market. But due to its rigid nature, stucco can develop cracks and holes over time due to sediment and surface damage.
          <p class="paragraph-6">
            When a crack or hole appears, it is necessary to take prompt action before any more damage can occur and further penetrate the surface area.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-6">
            You can try to repair cracks yourself but the money you save in the short term will cost you in the long run if you improperly repair your stucco. The future repairs costs can potentially run into the thousands.
