          <p>Cracks in stucco often happen due to water penetration, floods,  or physical forces, but they can also happen for a variety of  reasons. Here are the most common we've seen:</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul role="list">
            <li><strong>Wrong mix proportions</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Insufficient mixing</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Poor workmanship</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Seismic movement</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal changes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Environmental factors (rocks, baseballs, etc.)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The house settling process </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Shrinkage-induced stresses</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>stucco damage</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>‍<strong>Micro fractures</strong></h3>
          <p>Cracks from environmental sources cause micro-fractures that   may not be immediately visible. But they can slowly develop into  structural damage over time. Structural damage can cause water to  spill through and compress and expand the wall when exposed to   different temperatures.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>‍<strong>Structural damage</strong></h3>
          <p>A common form of structural damage comes from vehicle impacts,   hailstones, fire, and floods. This type of damage undermines  stuccos structural integrity, which eventually requires repairs.</ p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3><strong>Poor workmanship</strong></h3>
          <p>These types of cracks often develop during the construction  period. It&#x27;s essential to check your stucco walls   post-construction period thoroughly.<b>Harbor Stucco</b> follows all manufacturing standards. We have an inspection  period to ensure the settling and curing periods are up to par.</p>

          <h2>stucco cracks</h2>
          <p>We&#x27;ve listed different types of stucco cracks that tend to occur. They happen for many reasons, but they&#x27;re  going to tell you how you can repair stucco cracks.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3><strong>Pattern Cracking:</strong></h3>
          <figure style="max-width:" class="w-richtext-align-normal   w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/pattern-cracking.jpg" loading="lazy"  alt="Pattern Cracking"></div>
          </figure>
          <p>If you see cracking that fits a similar pattern. Most of the   time, it appears like a grid of horizontal and vertical lines.  This cracking occurs if there were issues with the lath when   mounted. It was likely not nailed, which raises the chances it  will lead to even more cracks in the future. Make sure you hire the right contractors when you need this type of stucco repair.</  p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4><strong>Spider Web Cracks</strong></h4>
          <figure style="max-width:" class="w-richtext-align-normal   w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/spiderweb-cracks.jpg" loading="lazy"  width="191" alt="Spider Web Cracks"></div>
          </figure>
          <p>These cracks throughout your stucco wall look like spider webs.   If you see this in your stucco, it&#x27;s a sign that the   contractors failed to cure your stucco base coat.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3><strong>Hairline Cracks:</strong></h3>
          <figure style="max-width:" class="w-richtext-align-normal   w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/hairline-cracks.jpg" loading="lazy"   alt="Hairline Cracks"></div>
          </figure>
          <p>These cracks tend to be thin, usually about 1/16 inch wide or  shorter. They will be the most frequent form of cracks you&#x27;ll   discover. Usually, in new homes and buildings, plaster settles and  shifts during construction. Stucco shrinks as it hardens and gains   strength. This shrinkage, when restrained, can create hairline  cracks.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3><strong>Foam Trim Cracks:</strong></h3>
          <figure style="max-width:" class="w-richtext-align-normal   w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/foam-trim-crack.jpg" loading="lazy"   alt="Foam Trim Cracks"></div>
          </figure>
          <p>Foam trims will often develop cracks when fiberglass mesh tape   is not used upon installation. Cracking here indicates poor   workmanship. The main concern with this type of damage is that it   will lead to expansion and shrinkage of the surface area, allowing  for cracks to develop over time.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3><strong>Diagonal Cracking:</strong></h3>
          <figure style="max-width:" class="w-richtext-align-normal   w-richtext-figure-type-image">
            <div><img src="images/diagonal-cracking.png" loading="lazy"   alt="Diagonal Cracking" ></div>
          </figure>
          <p>As the name suggests, these cracks are diagonal and can be found  near windows and doors. These cracks tend to occur because of  seismic shifts in the foundation.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
          <p>Repairing and patching stucco is a highly specialized,   labor-intensive process that requires both training and   experience. Harbor Stucco has extensive expertise in identifying  and repairing a wide range of stucco issues, and we complete every   project in line with strict manufacturer standards.</p>

        <h2>Repairing Stucco</h2>
        <p>There are as many ways to repair stucco as there are different types of stucco cracks. But generally speaking, these are the most common stucco repair methods used.</p>
        <ol start="" role="list">
          <li>Apply caulking into the crack </li>
          <li>Mesh over cracks</li>
          <li>Entire wall reapplication along with recoat and finish coat</li>
        </ol>
        <p>‍</p>
        <blockquote><em>&quot;What happens if I don&#x27;t repair my stucco?&quot;</em></blockquote>
        <p>Like any other issue, if left unattended, before long, it has the potential to turn into a much bigger and expensive problem to fix.</p>
        <p>So the simple answer is, as soon as you can.</p>
        <p>It is wise to attend to even the most minute cracks right away; small cracks can develop into bigger ones over time, usually because they are not noticed.</p>
        <p>Medium cracks can also turn into nightmares. Water could get in and cause mold and moisture problems. They&#x27;re hard to fix if you don&#x27;t find them in time. The sooner the cracks are repaired, the less likely they will cause significant problems in the future.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <blockquote><em>&quot;When do I have no option but to call a professional?&quot;</em></blockquote>
        <p>If you notice pattern cracks, the underlying lath is damaged and in need of repair. Many try to attempt to do this themselves, especially if the damage appears to be minimal. Call a professional to inspect severe structural damage. Harbor Stucco will repair it according to industry standards.</p>
        <p>If you notice wide or diagonal cracks, there is likely a problem with your house&#x27;s foundation. Usually, it&#x27;s caused by seismic shifts. </p>
        <p>In such cases, it is best to call Harbor Stucco. We will first deal with your home or building&#x27;s structural problem. Then do the exterior repair. If you avoid this, you&#x27;re going to continue to develop more cracks over time. Cracks have the potential to get water into them, which can turn into a health hazard if mold grows.</p>
