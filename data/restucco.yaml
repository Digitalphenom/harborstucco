    Frequently asked questions
  questions:
  - How can I change the color of my stucco house?:
    - You can achieve a color change of your home using LaHabra Fog Coat or Acrylic Stucco. Both materials are excellent and long-lasting. But ultimate durability depends on the quality of preparation and repair work done.
    - What we do is, First make any necessary stucco repair work. Then we prepare the structure to receive the Fog Coat or Acrylic stucco.
    - Cement-based color (Fogging):
    - Cement-based color coats are by far the most widely used exterior finish materials. LaHabra Stucco is the largest supplier of stucco color products in the Nation. Their pigments are pre-mixed into every stucco bag. Colored cement-based stucco is explicitly intended for cement substrate following proper preparation procedures.
    - Acrylic Paint:
    - Additional preparation will be used if you choose to add Acrylic Paint to cement or stucco surfaces. Keep in mind;  acrylic paint is not inherently a cement-based material. Acrylic finishing coat may be longer-lasting than its cement stucco alternative, but it can also be problematic.
  - Can you put new stucco over old stucco?:
    - Beware of so-called &quot;professionals&quot; who claim they can stucco over an existing home or building&#x27;s finish. Although you can stucco-over an existing finish. Make sure the the necessary steps to ensure the new layer&#x27;s stability are taken.
    - We typically do not recommend it. At least not without first determining the integrity of your substrate and current coat. Failure to do so can lead to the premature failure of your stucco project. We advise you to stay away from &quot;el cheapo&quot; contractors who will cut corners and cost you more money in the long-run.
  - How do you know if your stucco is going bad?:
    - Look for signs of deterioration around windows and doors. Dark spots, stains, cracks, or entire broken patches of stucco can appear on your tiles. Water-damaged buildings and structures are often caused by broken or damaged stucco walls. If you suspect water damage, you can find a strange scent of wet, rotting wood when you get close enough.
    - Damaged stucco allows moisture to invade your home or business. Moisture entering the building&#x27;s walls can cause mold, mildew, and bacteria accumulation over time. Mold problems quickly turn into a health hazard.
